Personalized Treatment Recommendations via Contextual Bradley-Terry Models

# Setup:
Run the Jupyter notebook from start to finish. There's only one non-native dependency (SentenceTransformers), which is downloaded using pip. A standard Python Colab environment should otherwise handle all the dependency management—no need for a requirements.txt file!

You will need to download the UCI Drug Reviews Dataset [here]([url](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/461/drug+review+dataset+druglib+com)) and upload it in to your local Colab directory. Other than that, the notebook should run smoothly.

No other files or documents should be necessary.

The runtime is < 10 minutes from start-to-finish. The experiments were run using a free, T4 GPU.
